## About

Author: Philip Reasa

This is a quick Next.js app that displays country data.

I choose to use Next.js because I wanted to learn a new framework.

The only "extra" thing I did was made the table responsive on smaller screens.

I did have some fun with styling, but ultimately - Im not a designer so sorry it looks bad.

## Getting Started

- yarn // To install dependencies
- yarn next dev // To run the dev server
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes
I did not write any tests, but in a real world scinerio I very much should have. I should also abstract the api call to get countries behind something that is easy to mock/fake in tests
